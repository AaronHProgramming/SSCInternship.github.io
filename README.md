# Week one:	
Day one: I was taught Python from simple syntax to different methods that are useful such as len(), enumerate()

Day two: I learned about Linux and began reading about Generators, practiced python

Day three: I completed my prime number finder as a program and turned it into a generator and then adapted it to use the send() method, created a git account

Day four: I learned linear algebra. (ex. F(c(a + b)) = c(F(a) + F(b)).  I also learned python exception handling. As an exercise I coded how to calculate a dot product Xcomponent1 times Xcomponent2 + Ycomponent1 times Ycomponent2 = dot product.

Day five: I learned about decorators, functions that return functions. Worked on [random walks](Graphs/randomWalksAndExtra.ipynb).

# Week two:
Day six: I gained experience with linux, learned about how arrays work, created StackOverflow account, completed 2D random_walk program.

Day seven: Took introductory javascript tutorial, progressed on reading in csv and formatting as geojson, having big troubles with plotting

Day eight: Succeeded in plotting observations, cleaned up pycharm, 

Day nine: Consolidated files into folders and deleted useless files.

# Week three:
Day ten: Installed LAMP, learned about databases

Day eleven: Loaded AISdata into database

Day twelve: Went to Network Security event, made python code get specific selects from the MyPHPAdmin

Day thirteen: Made map get points from database instead of file. Learned about functions as paramaters.

Day fourteen: Transferred files from laptop to desktop. Redownloaded many things.

# Week four:
Day fifteen: Finished downloading everything. Fixed up dbconnect.py.

Day sixteen: I taught simple python syntax to the other interns, and helped Jake learn programming logic.

Days seventeen through twenty-two: Redid the first 3 weeks by helping interns.

# Week five:
Days twenty-three through twenty-six: Worked on a clump builder, and helped teach Max and Jake more

# Week six:
Day twenty-seven: Worked on clump builder, retaught linalg

Day twenty-eight: Worked on clump builder, retaught linalg

Day twenty-nine: Signal Processing

Day thirty: Spent hours, updating and clarifying my README.md


# Specific commands in linux to remember
```sh
$ ipython notebook
```
 to open general ipython notebook
 
```sh
$ ipython notebook file.ipynb
```
to open specific .ipynb
```sh
$ /opt/pycharm-community-4.5.1/bin/pycharm.sh
```
to open pycharm
```sh
$ xdg-open { file | URL }
```
Opens a file, or window in your browser

You can alias commands to speed up typing

xdg-open --> cwin - "create window"
